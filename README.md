This project is build in three sections. First section includes "Header" and the "Headline", second section includes "Works" and "About Me" page, third section in the footer is Contact form.  `The mobile Menu` is in the header section of the mobile version, which uncludes the logo, named "My Logo" and navbar, and background template, icons. The second section includes pictures and icons. Third section a background template. All elements (background and icons, logo) were exported from Figma phototype. Also, I parse a Figma design to create a UI. In the form, the data is collected by using `Formspree service(https://formspree.io/html)`.
