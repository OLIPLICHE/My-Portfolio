This project is build in three sections. First section includes "Header" and the "Headline", second section includes "Works" and "About Me" page, third section in the footer is Contact form. The header section uncludes the logo, named "My Logo" and navbar, and background template, icons. The second section includes pictures and icons. Third section a background template. All elements (background and icons, logo) were exported from Figma phototype. Also, I parse a Figma design to create a UI. In the form, the data is collected by using `Formspree service(https://formspree.io/html)`.
